A loyal vassal to her liege, she lives to serve as his sword and shield. With a silent voice will she sing: tremble, ye mortals, for rise shall the king.

"Pokemon once ruled the world.

They built civilizations. They invented language. They understood magicks while science still baffles our inferior minds. Even their weapons of yore were orders of magnitude stronger than anything we can produce today.

So why does man now thrive, and Pokemon serve? It is simple, really.

Man created the Pokeball.

They did not."
